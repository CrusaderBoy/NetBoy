## 🎯 Purpose & Philosophy

NetBoy is my personal contribution to the IT community.  
It is **permanently free**, **transparent**, and intended to live on as a **legacy**.

> “I want NetBoy to remain free – for everyone, forever.”

A designated successor is in place and will continue development responsibly once I step away.
